Shorewall Role : DEVELOPMENT
=============================

This is the initial step for development.

Requirements
------------

This will require :

- docker

As well as the following Python modules:

- molecule (current 2.16)
- docker-py ()

I'm currently using a Mac book for development and am using `pyenv` installed
via homebrew's `brew` command.

Environment setup
-----------------

To recreate my environment :

Install [homebrew]

```
git clone ...
brew install pyenv

pyenv virtualenv ...
pyenv activate

pip install -r requiremtns.txt

```
